					<p class="titillium before-after-copy">Currently in a relationship, has always been tough on herself about her curves/hips, loves her animals and new puppy, is a book nerd, was scared to death to do her session but wanted to celebrate her recent accomplishments and to surprise her boyfriend as a Birthday gift. We used a nice soft palette to clear any red skin issues related to her Irish skin tones and to allow those green eyes to pop. She had just changed her hair color so we made sure to work with that as well.</p>

					<p class="titillium before-after-copy-left">Engaged to be married soon, works full time for her very close family, was worried about scars due too many knee surgeries from sports, worried about her acne, a very strong athletic build, very confident. Kayli was doing her session as a surprise grooms gift to be given the morning of the wedding. We chose a palette of browns and peaches to go beautifully with her hair and skin color. With the correct foundation and an amazing make-up artist, her skin photographed gorgeous.</p>
